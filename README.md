# Assessment
This is the brief for an assessment.
The module is taught to students at [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie).
The lecturer is [Ian McLoughlin](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io).

#### Compilation
The document is written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), and a [TeX distribution](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) is required to compile it.
The LaTeX package [minted](https://github.com/gpoore/minted) is also required.
It can then be compiled with:
```bash
$ latexmk
```
